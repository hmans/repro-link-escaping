The following link has a URL with an ampersand, but it's getting escaped to `&amp;`, which is wrong:

[link with ampersand](https://img.shields.io/github/workflow/status/hmans/miniplex/Tests?label=CI&style=for-the-badge)

The following image embed has the same problem:

![image with an ampersand](https://img.shields.io/github/workflow/status/hmans/miniplex/Tests?label=CI&style=for-the-badge)

(Don't let the fact that an image is still being displayed confuse you. If you look at the image tag's `href` attribute, you will see that the ampersand was erroneously escaped.)
